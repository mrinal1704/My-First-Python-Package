# My-First-Python-Package

## Introduction
This repo contains the files of a python package developed by me which automates the task of getting basic insights from data. 

## Functions
This package helps in automating the following everyday tasks of data analysis:

      - Calculates the dimensions of the dataset
      - Shows the basic info of the data
      - Calculates number of Unique values
      - Calculates percentage of null values
      - Plots the bar chart for all categorical columns
      - Plots the histogram for all numeric columns
      - Makes a heatmap to show the null values
      
## How to install, import, and run
- You can either go to the link: https://test.pypi.org/project/Mrinal/#files
- Or download all the files in the repo and open command prompt in the same folder containing the
  setup.py file. 
  - Then execute `pip install .`
  - Then to import this in python, type "from Mrinal import Insights"
  - Then create an object: `insight_1 = Insights(df)` where df is the dataframe object of your data
  - Then run `insight_1.automate_analysis()`, this would execute all the above mentioned tasks
